Demonstrate POS Tagging on any news article.
POS tagging is one of the
important aspects of NLP. It is to be used for entity and intent classification. Use any news
article and NLP libraries and find out all parts of speech in the chosen article. The output can
be in the form of a table that lists out nouns, verbs, etc along with their corresponding data
and count. Alternatively you can print each of them separately.
